h1. jQuery.bind-first

bind-first is a tiny jQuery plugin for moving event handler to the beginning of the event queue so that this handler will be executed first, regardless of how many other handlers you had already attached.

Using jQuery.bind-first you may be sure that your event handler will be executed first, regardless of its actual appearance in the code.

h2. Usage

<pre><code>$(/* selector */).onFirst(/* arguments  */);	// (only jQuery >= 1.7)
$(/* selector */).bindFirst(/* arguments  */);
$(/* selector */).delegateFirst(/* arguments  */);
$(/* selector */).liveFirst(/* arguments  */);
$(/* selector */).oneFirst(/* arguments  */);
</code></pre>

The arguments are completely identical to the corresponding jQuery functions: "bind":http://api.jquery.com/bind/, "delegate":http://api.jquery.com/delegate/, "live":http://api.jquery.com/live/, "one":http://api.jquery.com/one/ and "on":http://api.jquery.com/on/.

h2. Example

<pre><code>$('#bind a')
	// regular bind: binded first, will be runned second
	.bind('click', function() {
		alert('regular bind');
		return false;
	})
	// bindFirst: binded second, will be runned first
	.bindFirst('click', function() {
		alert('bindFirst');
		return false;
	});
</code></pre>
